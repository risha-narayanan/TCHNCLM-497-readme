Students love repping their school spirit at games and tailgates. But college-specific clothing is often expensive, hard to find, and unsustainable, and most times after students graduate, they don't use their tailgating merch anymore.

## **Challenges**

Server Hosting ‚Äì Struggled with local vs. cloud hosting

Image Storage ‚Äì Linking images to items in Firebase was harder than expected (Base64 decoding workaround)

## **Accomplishments**

‚≠ê Fully functioning React Native app with Firebase integration

‚≠ê Polished frontend + cohesive color scheme

‚≠ê Unique logins per user

‚≠ê Item listing + cart functionality live

## **What We Learned**

Mobile development is harder than it looks (UI + API quirks)

Cloud hosting and image handling can be deceptively tricky

Good UX requires iteration, testing, and design balance

## **Roadmap (What‚Äôs Next)**

1. AI auto-tagging of uploaded images

2. Location filtering to find nearby listings

3. Attribute-based filtering (size, category, style)

4. Multi-campus expansion
