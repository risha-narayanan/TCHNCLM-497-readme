## **Inspiration**

Students love repping their school spirit at games and tailgates. But college-specific clothing is often expensive, hard to find, and unsustainable, and most times after students graduate, they don't use their tailgating merch anymore.

CampusCloset makes it easy for students to trade and thrift campus gear â€” strengthening community and reducing waste!

## **Features**

ðŸ‘• Student Marketplace â€“ Buy, sell, and trade campus gear

ðŸ›’ Cart System â€“ Add, save, and check out items you love

ðŸ§‘ User Profiles â€“ Track your listings, purchases, and sales

ðŸ“¸ Easy Uploads â€“ Snap, upload, and share spirit wear with others

## **Architecture**

(Insert C4 diagram or system diagram here â€” e.g., ![Architecture](assets/architecture.png))

Frontend: React Native (Expo)

Backend/Database: Firebase (auth, data, storage)

## **FAQ**

Q: Who can use CampusCloset?  
A: Any student with a valid campus login.

Q: Is this secure?  
A: Yes! Authentication + data storage are handled via Firebase.

Q: Does it work cross-campus?  
A: Currently scoped to one university, but multi-campus support is on the roadmap.

## **Challenges**

Server Hosting â€“ Struggled with local vs. cloud hosting.

Image Storage â€“ Linking images to items in Firebase was harder than expected (Base64 decoding workaround).

## **Accomplishments**

1. Fully functioning React Native app with Firebase integration

2. Polished frontend + cohesive color scheme

3. Unique logins per user

4. Item listing + cart functionality live

## **What We Learned**

Mobile development is harder than it looks (UI + API quirks)

Cloud hosting and image handling can be deceptively tricky

Good UX requires iteration, testing, and design balance

## **Roadmap (Whatâ€™s Next)**

1. AI auto-tagging of uploaded images

2. Location filtering to find nearby listings

3. Attribute-based filtering (size, category, style)

4. Multi-campus expansion
